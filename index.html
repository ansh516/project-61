        <p>
            I like reading because I like to lern about different subjects and I like to lern new words. It also shrapens my knowledge. I also like it because there are so many kinds of books to read and so many reading websites to visit. I own a lot of books so when I get free time I like to sit beside my bookshelf,pick out a book and begin to read. I love to read chapter books and comics. One of my favorite book sireies is ever after high and I love to read dog man. I also love books written by Raina Telgemeier. One of my favorite reading websites is Epic which is provided by my school. although Epic has a time limit I still try to read a lot and sometimes I even pause my work just to read a book on there.
